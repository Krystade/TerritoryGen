# TerritoryGen
Console based procedural territory generator

# To Run
* No additional libraries are required, simply download territoryGen.py and run it through the console. (For my machine the command is *py /location/territoryGen.py* Depending on your version of python it may differ)
* Once the program is downloaded and running you will be prompted for the width, height, and number of factions to generate a map for.

Before generating the completed map the "seed" will be displayed with each faction's starting position shown.
Progress of the map's generation will be printed until the map is fully generated.

If the program is run from Python's Integrated Development and Learning Environment (IDLE) then the factions will be colored 1 of 7 colors.
