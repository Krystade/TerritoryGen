# TerritoryGen
Console based procedural territory generator

Insert the desired width and height of the map along with the number of factions to generate territory for.

Before generating the completed map the "seed" will be displayed with each faction's starting position shown.
Progress of the map's generation will be printed until the map is fully generated.

If the program is run from Python's Integrated Development and Learning Environment (IDLE) then the factions will be colored 1 of 7 colors.
